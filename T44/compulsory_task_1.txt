1.
a) Data - store of numbers, characters or symbols which viewing alone (without context) is hard to draw value or insights from
b) Field - defines the meaning of the data sat within it (provides context)
c) Record - collection of fields which relate to a person, place or thing 
d) File - A larger set of data with multiple records which have the same fields populated 

2. DBMS - Database management system.
Advantages of DBMS;
- Share data: provides the platform which is managed so users can easily access and manipulate the data so they can get quickly draw insights on the underlying data.
- Data integration: data can be accessed in an efficient and effective way so multiple systems can speak to each other in a more seamless manner. 
- Minimised data inconsistency: ensures good management of held data so it is held in a centralised places and placed into logical structures.
- Data access: easier to add/update/delete data (less chances of mistake due to better user tooling)
- Better decision making: Better availability and advanced manipulation of data will allow for better insights to be made which decisions are made off the back of.

3. Data alone is just characters/numbers/symbols and is effectively useless as it holds no context. Information has been drawn from set conditions and logic and therefore provides insights.

4. Metadata is defined as the data providing information about one or more aspects of the data; it is used to summarise basic information about data that can make tracking and working with specific data easier.

5. 
e) 4 records in the file 
f) 5 fields per record
